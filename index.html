</p><b>Municipal Theatre</b></p>
<p>The Lesya Ukrainka Lviv Drama Theatre was founded in 1931 in Kiev. It was established as the Red Army All-Ukrainian Theater. Theatre renaming depended on the name of the district. It initially had different names - Ukrainian Red Army Theatre (URAT), Ukrainian Military District Theatre (UMDT), and Kyiv Special Military District Theatre (KSMDT). In January 1954, it first performed in Lviv under the name as the Carpathian Military District Drama Theatre, becoming the first repertory military theater in Western Ukraine.

Since Ukraine’s independence, the theatre worked as the Western Operational Command Theatre. In 1996, theater funding altogether ceased. Finally on January 1, 2008 the city took over support of the theatre which was renamed the Lviv Municipal Theatre. In the spring of 2009, Lyudmila Kolosovych, distinguished Artist of Ukraine, was appointed artistic director. On April 21, 2011, the Lviv City Council renamed yet again the Municipal Theatre for Lesya Ukrainka Lviv Drama Theatre.</p>
